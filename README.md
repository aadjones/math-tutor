Basic chatbot wrapper of GPT with system prompts to behave more tutorlike
## How to use
First, install the python dependencies of OpenAI and streamlit with pip:

  `pip install openai`
  
  `pip install streamlit`
  
You'll also need an OpenAI API key for GPT 3.5 or GPT 4. Put this in your Streamlit secrets.

To run the code, from the base directory, run

`streamlit run tutor.py`
